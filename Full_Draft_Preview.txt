For my full draft, I currently have a 15 male stick figures, and 5 female stick figures. This matches the statistic I found at the bottom that says 25% of people in tech our women. I think these stick figures are a good example of visual hierachy in my work. In addition, the quote I included is a quote from the COO of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg. I'm still not quite sure about the quote, but for now I think it is okay and matches my idea enough. Though I think there are probably better quotes out there. I did manage to change the background from white to grey, though I think it is kind of boring so I may try to make a change or try and add "something" to it to make it more interesting. I also added two computer icons on either side of my quote to fill some of the empty space as I thought there was a little too much space. One additional thing I would like to change at some point soon is the font of the text, as I think there are fonts (maybe typewriter style?) that may look a bit more digital or I might try and make the letters look more 3D like a tutorial I watched a while ago.
