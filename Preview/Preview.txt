For my preview, I currently have a quote displayed as well as an image of a female "stick figure" and two male "stick figures". I plan on adding more stick figures and having it kind of having it relate to a statistic I plan to include towards the bottom of the page (not yet found). An example of how this would look would be "Only 20% of women in the tech field are women" (I just made that up, but it's probably close to true), then at the top I will have 3 female stick figures and 12 male stick figuers (women would be 20% of the stick figures shown). In addition, the quote I included is a quote from the COO of Facebook Sheryl Sandberg. The quote relates to women in tech, but I don't think it was quite what I am looking for so it's serving more as a placeholder to show that the bottom half of the page will be a lot of texts, that relate to the top half.
In addition, as for one thing I am struggling with I was trying to change the white background to black, and I am sure it is really easy but I was looking up online how to do it and all of the pages I found were either using an older version of GIMP or I just didn't understand it. I was probably going to change the black image, to be more of a computer desktop sort of image anyway so I guess it doesn't matter that much. I am finding GIMP to be really hard to use though, even the small amount I did took me a while so this project is definitely going to take me longer than I may have initially thought.
