For my visual argument "Women in Computing, Now That's IT..." (get it IT = Information Technology), I wanted to focus on the fact that we need more women in the tech industry. As a Women in Computer Science (tech field), this is a topic that I hear people talk about a lot and I definitely notice that women are lacking in numbers in the field. In one of my CS classes in high school, I was 1 of 4 girls in a 25 person class. Therefore, it's something that I have noticed quite a bit, so I thought my visual argument would be a great place to call for more women in the tech field.
